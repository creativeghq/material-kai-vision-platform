## 🎯 WHAT YOU ASKED FOR

> "Can we test now all of our flows that they work together? I want you to remove OR merge better if you think so, any scripts we have under /scripts and build a script that basically mimics front end work. Upload a PDF, follow the flow of uploading, ensure that all the steps are executed, show the output of all steps and then do a search on that embedding generation. Is that something you can build?"

---

## ✅ WHAT WAS DELIVERED

### 1. ✅ Unified Workflow Script
**File**: `scripts/end-to-end-workflow.js`

A single, comprehensive script that:
- ✅ Uploads PDF to Supabase storage
- ✅ Triggers PDF processing via MIVAA gateway
- ✅ Monitors job progress with polling
- ✅ Verifies chunks extraction
- ✅ Verifies images extraction
- ✅ Verifies embeddings generation
- ✅ Performs search on embeddings
- ✅ Shows output at each step
- ✅ Saves complete results to JSON

**Usage**:
```bash
node scripts/end-to-end-workflow.js
```

---

### 2. ✅ Complete Documentation
Three comprehensive documentation files:

#### `COMPREHENSIVE_WORKFLOW_TESTING.md` ⭐ **START HERE**
- Executive summary
- Workflow architecture
- What gets tested
- Expected output
- Configuration
- Success criteria
- Troubleshooting

#### `END_TO_END_WORKFLOW_SUMMARY.md`
- Detailed step breakdown
