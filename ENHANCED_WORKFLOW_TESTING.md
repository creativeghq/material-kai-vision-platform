## 🔍 DETAILED COMPONENTS

### 1. **Layout Analysis** 📐

Analyzes document structure and design:

```javascript
{
  composition: {
    layout_type: 'grid',
    balance: 'asymmetrical',
    alignment: 'left',
    spacing_consistency: 0.85,
    visual_hierarchy_score: 0.90
  },
  design_principles: {
    contrast: 0.88,
    repetition: 0.82,
    alignment: 0.90,
    proximity: 0.85,
    white_space_usage: 0.78
  },
  content_distribution: {
    text_chunks: 45,
    images: 12,
    text_to_image_ratio: 3.75,
    average_chunk_size: 450
  },
  responsive_design: {
    mobile_friendly: true,
    breakpoint_consistency: true,
    adaptive_elements: [...]
  }
}
```

**Metrics Tracked**:
- ✅ Layout type (grid, asymmetrical, centered, etc.)
- ✅ Visual hierarchy score
- ✅ Design principle scores
- ✅ Content distribution
- ✅ Responsive design assessment

---

### 2. **Quality Scoring** ⭐

Evaluates chunk quality:

```javascript
{
  coherence_score: 0.85,
  boundary_quality: 0.95,
  semantic_completeness: 0.90,
  overall_quality: 0.88
}
```

**Quality Metrics**:
- ✅ **Coherence Score** (0-1) - Content length and structure
- ✅ **Boundary Quality** (0-1) - Proper sentence boundaries
- ✅ **Semantic Completeness** (0-1) - Relevant keywords present
- ✅ **Overall Quality** (0-1) - Weighted average

**Scoring Formula**:
```
Overall = (Coherence × 0.3) + (Boundary × 0.4) + (Semantic × 0.3)
```

**Results**:
- High quality chunks (≥0.8)
- Low quality chunks (<0.6)
- Average quality score

---

### 3. **Similarity Testing** 🔗

Tests cosine similarity between chunks:

```javascript
{
  tested_pairs: 10,
  average_similarity: 0.72,
  min_similarity: 0.45,
  max_similarity: 0.95
}
```

**Similarity Calculation**:
```
similarity = (A · B) / (||A|| × ||B||)
```

**What's Tested**:
- ✅ Similarity between first 5 chunks
- ✅ All pairwise comparisons
- ✅ Average similarity score
- ✅ Min/max similarity range

**Interpretation**:
- High similarity (>0.8) = Similar content
- Medium similarity (0.5-0.8) = Related content
- Low similarity (<0.5) = Different content

---

### 4. **Retrieval Quality Metrics** 📊

Evaluates search result quality:

```javascript
{
  precision: 0.85,
  recall: 0.78,
  mrr: 0.92,
  ndcg: 0.88,
  relevant_results: 17,
  total_results: 20
}
```

**Metrics Explained**:

- **Precision** = Relevant results / Total results
  - Measures accuracy of search
  - Higher is better (0-1)

- **Recall** = Retrieved relevant / All relevant
  - Measures completeness
  - Higher is better (0-1)

- **MRR** (Mean Reciprocal Rank) = 1 / rank of first relevant
  - Measures ranking quality
  - Higher is better (0-1)

- **NDCG** (Normalized DCG) = Discounted cumulative gain
  - Measures ranking quality with relevance scores
  - Higher is better (0-1)

---

### 5. **Performance Metrics** ⏱️

Tracks timing for each operation:

```javascript
{
  "PDF Upload": [4523],
  "Processing Trigger": [234],
  "Job Processing": [187234],
  "Search Query": [1234]
}
```

**Metrics Tracked**:
- ✅ PDF Upload time
- ✅ Processing trigger time
- ✅ Job processing time
- ✅ Search query time
- ✅ Total workflow time

|-------|----------|
| Low quality scores | Check chunk extraction, may need better PDF parsing |
| Low similarity scores | Content may be too diverse, check document type |
| Low precision | Search query may be too specific, try broader terms |
| Low recall | May need more relevant documents in database |
| Timeout | Increase max attempts or check MIVAA service |
