A comprehensive end-to-end workflow test that:
1. ✅ Uploads PDF to Supabase storage
2. ✅ Triggers PDF processing via MIVAA gateway
3. ✅ Monitors job progress with polling
4. ✅ Verifies chunks extraction
5. ✅ Verifies images extraction
6. ✅ Verifies embeddings generation

- Returns: search results with similarity scores

**Expected Output**:
```
🔄 [timestamp] STEP 6: Performing search: "material design"
✅ [timestamp] STEP 6: Search completed successfully
📋 [timestamp] STEP 6: Found 10 results
📋 [timestamp] STEP 6: Result 1: "..." (score: 0.892)
📋 [timestamp] STEP 6: Result 2: "..." (score: 0.856)
📋 [timestamp] STEP 6: Result 3: "..." (score: 0.823)
```

## 🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If workflow fails at Step 1
**Issue**: PDF upload fails  
**Solution**: Check Supabase storage bucket, verify API key

### If workflow fails at Step 2
**Issue**: Processing trigger fails  
**Solution**: Check MIVAA gateway is deployed, verify API key

### If workflow fails at Step 3
**Issue**: Job monitoring timeout  
**Solution**: Check job status endpoint, increase timeout

### If workflow fails at Step 4-5
**Issue**: No chunks/images/embeddings  
**Solution**: Check MIVAA processing, verify database tables

### If workflow fails at Step 6
**Issue**: Search returns no results  
**Solution**: Check embeddings exist, verify search endpoint
