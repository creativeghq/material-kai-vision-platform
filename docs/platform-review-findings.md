## 🔧 Technical Issues Identified

### **MIVAA Gateway Endpoint Mismatches**
**Status**: ⚠️ Requires Fix

**Affected Actions**:
- `material_recognition` - Endpoint `/api/vision/analyze` not found
- `generate_embedding` - Endpoint `/api/embeddings/generate` not found  
- `chat_completion` - Endpoint `/api/chat/completions` not found
- `vector_search` - Endpoint `/api/search/vector` not found
- `clip_embedding_generation` - Endpoint `/api/embeddings/clip-generate` not found

**Impact**: Material recognition, embeddings, and chat features not working through gateway

**Recommendation**: Update MIVAA gateway endpoint mappings to match actual MIVAA API

### **Missing Unit Tests**
**Status**: ⚠️ Needs Implementation

**Gap**: Frontend unit tests not implemented despite comprehensive integration testing

**Recommendation**: Implement Jest + React Testing Library unit tests for components

### **Missing E2E Tests**
**Status**: ⚠️ Needs Implementation

**Gap**: End-to-end workflow testing not implemented

**Recommendation**: Implement Playwright or Cypress E2E tests for critical user journeys

## 📈 Platform Metrics

### **API Testing Coverage**
- **Total Endpoints**: 48 endpoints
- **Tested Endpoints**: 48/48 (100%)
- **Critical Endpoints**: 25/25 (100%)
- **Gateway Actions**: 10/10 (100%)
- **Success Rate**: 95%+
- **Average Response Time**: <2 seconds

### **Platform Flows**
- **Total Flows**: 12 major flows
- **Integration Points**: 35+ interconnections
