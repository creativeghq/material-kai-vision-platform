## 🚨 Critical Issues Identified

### Security Vulnerabilities (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. **Hardcoded API Keys**: Found in multiple files
2. **Weak CORS Configuration**: Wildcard origins in development
3. **JWT Secret Exposure**: Hardcoded in configuration files
4. **Missing Input Validation**: Several endpoints lack proper validation

### Technical Debt
1. **ESLint Configuration**: Outdated configuration causing lint failures
2. **Missing Database Migrations**: No migration files in supabase/migrations
3. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Mixed error handling patterns
4. **Test Coverage**: Incomplete test coverage across services

### Performance Issues
1. **Large Bundle Size**: Frontend bundle optimization needed
2. **Unoptimized Database Queries**: Missing indexes and query optimization
3. **Memory Leaks**: Potential memory leaks in long-running services

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. **Clone and Setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd material-kai-vision-platform
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Configure your environment variables
   ```

3. **Database Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Setup Supabase project
   # Run migrations (when available)
   ```

4. **Start Development**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
