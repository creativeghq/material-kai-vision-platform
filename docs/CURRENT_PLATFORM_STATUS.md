## ❌ What's Pending

### Retrieval Quality Integration (30 min)
**Files to Update**:
- `src/services/enhancedRAGService.ts`
- `src/services/ragKnowledgeService.ts`
- `src/components/Search/SemanticSearch.tsx`

**What to Add**:
```typescript
// After search results
const metrics = await RetrievalQualityService.evaluateRetrieval(
  query,
  retrievedChunks,
  relevantChunkIds
);
```

### Response Quality Integration (30 min)
**Files to Update**:
- `src/services/hybridAIService.ts`
- MIVAA LLM endpoints

**What to Add**:
```typescript
// After LLM response
const metrics = await ResponseQualityService.evaluateResponse(
  responseId,
  query,
  responseText,
  sourceChunks
);
```

### Documentation Updates (45 min)
- ✅ Platform flows updated with Phase 2-3
- ✅ Integration status documented
- ⏳ API documentation needs update

## 🚀 Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Today - 2 hours)
1. **Integrate Retrieval Quality** (30 min)
   - Add to `enhancedRAGService.ts`
   - Add to `ragKnowledgeService.ts`
   - Test with real searches

2. **Integrate Response Quality** (30 min)
   - Add to `hybridAIService.ts`
   - Test with real responses

3. **Verify End-to-End** (30 min)
   - Test PDF upload → quality scoring → relationships
   - Test search → retrieval quality
   - Test LLM response → response quality

4. **Update Documentation** (30 min)
   - API documentation
   - Admin panel guide
   - Integration guide

### Follow-up (Tomorrow)
1. Performance testing
2. Optimization if needed
3. Comprehensive testing with multiple PDFs
4. Deployment preparation
