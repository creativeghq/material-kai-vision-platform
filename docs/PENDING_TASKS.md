# Pending Tasks & Implementation Roadmap

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed
- Updated chunking configuration (1500/100/500/3000)
- Fixed MIVAA progress calculation
- Added layout-analysis step execution
- Fixed document naming (shows actual document name instead of "mivaa_pdf_extraction Document")
- Created document records in documents table
- Added document_name to chunk and image metadata
- Build verified and working

### Current Configuration
```typescript
{
  chunkSize: 1500,           // Larger chunks for better context
  overlap: 100,              // Reduced overlap to minimize redundancy
  minChunkSize: 500,         // Higher minimum for semantic completeness
  maxChunkSize: 3000,        // Higher maximum for complex sections
  preserveStructure: true,   // Maintain semantic boundaries
  respectHierarchy: true,    // Keep hierarchical elements together
}
```
