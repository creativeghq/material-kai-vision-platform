# Pending Tasks & Implementation Roadmap

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed
- Updated chunking configuration (1500/100/500/3000)
- Fixed MIVAA progress calculation
- Added layout-analysis step execution
- Fixed document naming (shows actual document name instead of "mivaa_pdf_extraction Document")
- Created document records in documents table
- Added document_name to chunk and image metadata
- Build verified and working

### Current Configuration
```typescript
{
  chunkSize: 1500,           // Larger chunks for better context
  overlap: 100,              // Reduced overlap to minimize redundancy
  minChunkSize: 500,         // Higher minimum for semantic completeness
  maxChunkSize: 3000,        // Higher maximum for complex sections
  preserveStructure: true,   // Maintain semantic boundaries
  respectHierarchy: true,    // Keep hierarchical elements together
}
```

## Advanced Optimization Techniques (For Implementation)

### Technique 1: Semantic Coherence Scoring
**Purpose**: Score chunks by semantic completeness  
**Implementation**: Calculate based on heading presence, content length, sentence count, images, metadata

### Technique 2: Context Window Optimization
**Purpose**: Preserve context at chunk boundaries  
**Implementation**: Include preceding/following context in embeddings

### Technique 3: Embedding Stability Metrics
**Purpose**: Measure embedding consistency  
**Implementation**: Compare with similar chunks, track variance

### Technique 4: Adaptive Chunk Sizing
**Purpose**: Adjust chunk size based on content type  
**Implementation**: Detect content type, apply appropriate config

### Technique 5: Embedding Batch Optimization
**Purpose**: Generate embeddings with consistency checks  
**Implementation**: Batch generation with validation

### Technique 6: Chunk Relationship Graph
**Purpose**: Build graph of semantic relationships  
**Implementation**: Sequential, semantic, hierarchical relationships

### Technique 7: Response Quality Validation
**Purpose**: Validate generated responses  
**Implementation**: Coherence, relevance, completeness, accuracy checks
