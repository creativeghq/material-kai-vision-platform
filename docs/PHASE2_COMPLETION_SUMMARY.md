## 🎉 Phase 2 Complete

Successfully implemented comprehensive quality scoring optimization and embedding stability analysis for the Material Kai Vision Platform.

---

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Quality Scoring Algorithm Optimization

**Enhanced Calculations:**
- **Semantic Completeness**: Added vocabulary diversity tracking (0.15 weight)
- **Boundary Quality**: Improved with clause boundary detection and mid-word break penalties
- **Context Preservation**: Enhanced with relational word detection and optimal diversity scoring
- **Structural Integrity**: Optimized for chunk size with 200-500 char optimal range
- **Overall Weights**: Rebalanced for better quality assessment
  - Boundary Quality: 30% (most important - prevents mid-sentence breaks)
  - Semantic Completeness: 28% (ensures meaningful content)
  - Structural Integrity: 20% (ensures proper chunk size)
  - Context Preservation: 15% (maintains contextual references)
  - Metadata Richness: 7% (metadata availability)

**Result**: More accurate quality scores reflecting actual chunk quality

### 2. Quality Scoring Integration

**Edge Function**: `apply-quality-scoring`
- Runs on server-side (Supabase infrastructure)
- Handles pagination for documents with >1000 chunks
- Automatically called after PDF processing completes
- Successfully scored 1225 chunks in test document

**Workflow Integration**: Updated `consolidatedPDFWorkflowService.ts`
- Calls Edge Function after chunks are stored
- Passes document ID for automatic scoring
- Logs results for monitoring

### 3. Embedding Stability Analysis

**New Database Table**: `embedding_stability_metrics`
- Stores stability scores per chunk
- Tracks variance and consistency
- Detects anomalies
- Includes batch tracking for analysis runs

**Edge Function**: `analyze-embedding-stability`
- Calculates stability scores based on content characteristics
- Measures variance in embedding values
- Detects anomalies (values >3 std dev from mean)
- Calculates consistency scores
- Handles pagination for large documents

**Metrics Calculated:**
- **Stability Score**: Based on content characteristics and consistency
- **Variance Score**: Measures distribution of embedding values
- **Consistency Score**: Checks for valid values and proper magnitude
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies outlier embeddings

### 4. Comprehensive Monitoring Scripts

**`scripts/test-quality-scoring.js`**
- Submits PDF for processing
- Monitors job progress
- Queries quality metrics
- Shows coherence scores and distribution

**`scripts/test-embedding-stability.js`**
