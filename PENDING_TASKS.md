## üî¥ CRITICAL PRIORITY TASKS

### 1. Remove Mock Data Fallbacks
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Impact**: Database filled with fake data, silent failures  
**Files**:
- `mivaa-pdf-extractor/app/services/real_image_analysis_service.py` (Lines 243-260, 339-363)

**Action**:
- Remove `_get_mock_llama_response()` method
- Remove `_get_mock_claude_response()` method
- Raise exceptions instead of returning mock data
- Ensure all AI calls fail loudly, not silently

**Estimated Time**: 3 hours

---

### 2. Remove Hardcoded Credentials
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Impact**: Security vulnerability  
**Files**:
- `src/components/PDF/EnhancedPDFProcessor.tsx` (Lines 36-37)

**Action**:
- Remove hardcoded Supabase URL and API key
- Ensure environment variables are required
- Add validation to throw errors if missing

**Estimated Time**: 1 hour

---

### 3. Fix Missing RPC Function
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Impact**: Vector search completely broken  
**Files**:
- `src/services/multiVectorSearchService.ts` (Lines 468, 565)

**Action**:
- Create `execute_raw_sql` RPC function in Supabase
- Test vector search functionality
- Validate search results

**Estimated Time**: 2 hours

---

## üü† HIGH PRIORITY TASKS

### 4. Fix Health Checks
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Impact**: Broken monitoring  
**Files**:
- `src/services/ml/unifiedMLService.ts` (Lines 665-674)

**Action**:
- Replace `health_check` table query with `workspaces` table query
- Test health check functionality

**Estimated Time**: 1 hour

---

### 5. Improve Error Handling
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Impact**: Silent failures  
**Files**:
- `src/services/base/ApiService.ts` (Lines 257-287)

**Action**:
- Add comprehensive logging for all errors
- Log retry attempts
- Throw errors with context

**Estimated Time**: 2 hours

---

### 6. Enable Quality Scoring
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Impact**: No quality metrics for chunks/images/products  
**Status**: System exists but not populated

**Action**:
- Enable quality scoring during chunk processing
- Populate: coherence_score, quality_score, boundary_quality, semantic_completeness
- Validate scores are being calculated

**Estimated Time**: 4 hours

---

## üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY TASKS

### 7. Fix Image-Chunk Associations
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: Poor retrieval quality  
**Current Issue**: Every image linked to ALL chunks

**Action**:
- Implement proximity-based chunk-image linking
- Link images only to chunks from same/nearby pages
- Use proximity scoring
- Limit to top 5-10 most relevant chunks

**Estimated Time**: 3 hours

---

### 8. Implement Smart Product Detection
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: 50% of auto-created products are not real products  
**Current Issue**: Creating products from index/sustainability/technical pages

**Action**:
- Implement product name patterns (UPPERCASE names)
- Detect dimension patterns (e.g., "12√ó45", "20√ó40")
- Skip index/sustainability/certification/technical pages
- Require minimum: name + dimensions + description

**Estimated Time**: 4 hours

---

### 9. Extract and Store Metafields
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: Cannot filter or search by metadata  
**Current Issue**: No metafield values for images or products

**Action**:
- Extract metafields: product_name, color, size, designer, dimensions, collection
- Store in metafield_values table
- Link to images and products

**Estimated Time**: 3 hours

---

### 10. Increase Product Coverage
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Impact**: Missing 50% of expected products  
**Current Issue**: Only 10 products created from 211 chunks

**Action**:
- Increase `max_products` limit or remove limit
- Process ALL chunks, not just first 10
- Use intelligent filtering to keep only real products

**Estimated Time**: 2 hours

---

## üìä ENHANCEMENT TASKS (Future)

### 11. Image Classification System
**Goal**: Classify images into 6 categories for intelligent routing

**Categories**:
1. Material Primary (show in product display)
2. Material Application (show in product display)
3. Technical Diagram (hidden by default, available as attachment)
4. Contextual Reference (hidden by default)
5. Informational (hidden by default)
6. Branding/Marketing (not shown, not searchable)

**Implementation**:
- Stage 1: Visual Classification (Claude Sonnet 4.5 Vision)
- Stage 2: Context Analysis (surrounding text)
- Stage 3: Weighted Decision (Visual 70%, Context 30%)

**Estimated Time**: 2 weeks

---

### 12. Enhanced Semantic Chunking
**Goal**: Reduce chunks from 60-80 per document to 30-45 with better quality

**Improvements**:
- Respect document structure (headings, sections, paragraphs)
- Identify natural semantic boundaries
- Keep related content together
- Adaptive sizing (1800 tokens target, 500-2500 range)

**Estimated Time**: 1 week

---

### 13. Product Variant Management
**Goal**: Detect and group product variants

**Features**:
- Detect variant dimensions (color, size, finish)
- Group variants under base products
- Track parent-child relationships
- Maintain both base product and variant records

**Estimated Time**: 1 week

---

### 14. Multi-Model Metadata Validation
**Goal**: Improve metadata completeness from 65% to 90%

**Pipeline**:
- Stage 1: Fast Classification (Claude Haiku 4.5)
- Stage 2: Detailed Extraction (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
- Stage 3: Validation & Enrichment (GPT-4o)

**Estimated Time**: 2 weeks
