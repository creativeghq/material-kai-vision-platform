# Consolidate Search Architecture to RAG-Only System

## Description

Refactor the current multi-layered search architecture to use a unified RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. This will simplify the codebase by eliminating redundant embedding-only search services and consolidating all search functionality through RAG services that can provide both document retrieval and intelligent responses.

## Background

Current search architecture has 11 different search services with overlapping functionality:
- Multiple embedding-only services (MivaaEmbeddingIntegration, vector-similarity-search)
- Multiple RAG services (enhancedRAGService, ragKnowledgeService, ragService)
- Redundant backend functions with similar capabilities

This creates complexity, maintenance overhead, and inconsistent user experiences.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All search functionality routes through a single unified RAG service
- [ ] UI components use only the unified RAG service
- [ ] Vector similarity and embedding functionality is internal to RAG services
- [ ] Redundant search services are removed
- [ ] All existing search capabilities are preserved
- [ ] Agent UI integration is simplified through single search interface
- [ ] Performance is maintained or improved
- [ ] All tests pass after refactoring

  search(query: string, options: SearchOptions): Promise<SearchResponse>
  suggest(partial: string): Promise<string[]>
  getAnalytics(): Promise<SearchAnalytics>
}

interface SearchOptions {
  mode: 'quick' | 'detailed' | 'hybrid'
  collections?: string[]
  filters?: SearchFilter[]
  maxResults?: number
  includeAnalytics?: boolean
}

interface SearchResponse {
  mode: 'quick' | 'detailed' | 'hybrid'

}
```

### Backend Function Structure
```typescript
// supabase/functions/unified-rag-search/index.ts
export default async function handler(req: Request) {
  const { query, mode, options } = await req.json()
  
  switch (mode) {
    case 'quick':
      return await retrieveDocuments(query, options)
    case 'detailed':
      return await generateRAGResponse(query, options)
    case 'hybrid':
      return await hybridSearch(query, options)
  }
}
```

## Success Metrics

- **Codebase Simplification**: Reduce search-related files from 11 to 3-4 core files
- **Performance**: Maintain <500ms response time for quick searches, <2s for detailed
- **Functionality**: 100% feature parity with existing search capabilities
- **Agent Ready**: Single integration point for agent UI
- **Maintainability**: Reduced complexity score and improved test coverage

## Risks & Mitigation

- **Risk**: Breaking existing integrations
  - **Mitigation**: Phased rollout with backward compatibility layer
- **Risk**: Performance degradation
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive performance testing and optimization
- **Risk**: Feature loss during consolidation
  - **Mitigation**: Detailed feature audit and migration checklist

## Dependencies

- OpenAI API access for embeddings and generation
- Supabase database with vector extensions
- Existing search data and indexes

## Notes

This refactoring will significantly simplify the search architecture while maintaining all existing functionality. The unified RAG service will serve as the single source of truth for all search operations, making the system more maintainable and agent-ready.

The consolidation follows the principle that RAG search includes embedding search as its first step, so we can provide both document retrieval and intelligent responses through a single service with different modes.
