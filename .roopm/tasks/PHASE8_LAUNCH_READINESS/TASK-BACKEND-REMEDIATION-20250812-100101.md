# Phase 8 Backend System Assessment Remediation

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

**What needs to be done?**
Comprehensive remediation of critical backend system gaps identified in the Phase 8 Multi-Modal MIVAA PDF Extractor launch readiness assessment. Current backend readiness is 85% with critical gaps in performance optimization, infrastructure scalability, security implementation, administrative tooling, and image analysis integration.

- Infrastructure scalability improvements (containerization, orchestration, load balancing)
- Security implementation (rate limiting, file validation, JWT authentication)
- Administrative tools development (monitoring endpoints, management dashboard)
- Image analysis integration (UI connectivity, processing pipeline optimization)

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ
