# Phase 8 Frontend Integration Status Remediation

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

**What needs to be done?**
Comprehensive remediation of critical frontend integration gaps identified in the Phase 8 Multi-Modal MIVAA PDF Extractor launch readiness assessment. Current frontend readiness is 65% with significant gaps in real-time features, batch processing UI, advanced search components, admin dashboard integration, and performance optimization.
