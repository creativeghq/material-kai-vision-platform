# Phase 2B: Dynamic Material Categories - Configuration Service & API Implementation

## 📋 Description

Implement the Configuration Service API layer and backend integration for the Dynamic Material Categories system, providing REST and GraphQL endpoints that interface with the database foundation established in Phase 2A.

This task focuses on **API and service implementation**: REST endpoints, GraphQL resolvers, Redis caching integration, real-time synchronization, and the configuration service that will replace hardcoded `MATERIAL_CATEGORIES` usage across the platform.

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria

### Configuration Service
- [ ] `/api/material-config` REST endpoints fully operational
- [ ] GraphQL resolvers handling complex category queries
- [ ] Redis caching layer integrated with database queries
- [ ] Real-time subscription handlers for category updates
- [ ] Service authentication and authorization implemented

### API Layer Integration
- [ ] Backward compatibility adapter for existing hardcoded usage
- [ ] Performance optimization meeting <100ms P95 response targets
- [ ] Error handling and fallback mechanisms operational
- [ ] API versioning and deprecation strategy implemented
- [ ] Integration testing covering all endpoint scenarios

### Frontend Integration Readiness
- [ ] Clean API contracts ready for React component integration
- [ ] Real-time event system prepared for UI updates
- [ ] Type definitions updated for TypeScript compatibility
