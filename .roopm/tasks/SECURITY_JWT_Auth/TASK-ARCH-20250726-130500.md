# Implement JWT Authentication Middleware for Mivaa Service

## Description üéØ

**Critical Security Gap**: The existing Mivaa PDF extractor service lacks JWT authentication middleware, creating a significant security vulnerability. This task implements comprehensive JWT authentication with workspace isolation to secure the Mivaa service according to the architectural patterns defined in [`docs/jwt_mivaa_integration_architecture_2025.md`](docs/jwt_mivaa_integration_architecture_2025.md).

**Current State**: 
- ‚úÖ Complete Mivaa PDF extractor service exists
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive JWT integration architecture documented
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL**: No authentication middleware in Mivaa service
- ‚ùå All Mivaa endpoints are currently unprotected

**Impact**: Without JWT authentication, the Mivaa service is vulnerable to unauthorized access and cannot support multi-tenant workspace isolation.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

### Security Requirements
- [ ] JWT authentication middleware implemented using patterns from architecture document
- [ ] All Mivaa API endpoints protected with authentication
- [ ] Token validation with expiration and blacklist checking
- [ ] Workspace-aware permission system implemented
- [ ] Security headers and CORS configuration applied

### Functional Requirements  
- [ ] Workspace isolation enforced at API level
- [ ] Permission-based access control (pdf:process, pdf:read, workspace:write, workspace:read)
- [ ] Error handling for authentication failures
- [ ] Integration with existing Supabase Auth patterns
- [ ] Redis integration for token blacklisting (optional but recommended)

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for JWT middleware components
- [ ] Integration tests for protected endpoints
- [ ] Security penetration testing scenarios
- [ ] Performance impact assessment
- [ ] Documentation for security implementation

## Implementation Checklist üìã

### Phase 1: Core JWT Middleware (Week 1)
- [ ] **üì£ Create JWT authentication middleware class** 
  - [ ] Implement `JWTAuthMiddleware` in [`mivaa-pdf-extractor/app/middleware/jwt_auth.py`](mivaa-pdf-extractor/app/middleware/jwt_auth.py)
  - [ ] Add token validation with required claims checking
  - [ ] Implement workspace context extraction
  - [ ] Add Redis blacklist support (optional)
  - [ ] Create permission decorator functions

- [ ] **üì£ Integrate middleware with FastAPI application**
  - [ ] Update [`mivaa-pdf-extractor/app/main.py`](mivaa-pdf-extractor/app/main.py) to include middleware
  - [ ] Configure security settings and CORS
  - [ ] Add environment variables for JWT configuration
  - [ ] Update dependency injection for authentication

- [ ] **üì£ Protect existing API endpoints**
  - [ ] Update [`mivaa-pdf-extractor/app/api/v1/pdf_processing.py`](mivaa-pdf-extractor/app/api/v1/pdf_processing.py)
  - [ ] Add authentication dependencies to all endpoints
  - [ ] Implement workspace-aware endpoint logic
  - [ ] Add permission checks for different operations

### Phase 2: Workspace Integration (Week 1-2)
- [ ] **üì£ Implement workspace-aware processing**
  - [ ] Create `WorkspacePDFProcessor` class
  - [ ] Add workspace context to all PDF operations
  - [ ] Implement workspace isolation in database queries
  - [ ] Update file storage to be workspace-scoped

- [ ] **üì£ Database integration with workspace context**
  - [ ] Implement workspace context setting for RLS policies
  - [ ] Update database models to include workspace_id
  - [ ] Create workspace-scoped query methods
  - [ ] Add workspace validation logic

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation (Week 2)
- [ ] **üì£ Create comprehensive test suite**
  - [ ] Unit tests for JWT middleware components
  - [ ] Integration tests for protected endpoints
  - [ ] Security tests for authentication bypass attempts
  - [ ] Performance tests for authentication overhead
  - [ ] End-to-end workflow tests

- [ ] **üì£ Security validation and documentation**
  - [ ] Security audit of implementation
  - [ ] Performance impact assessment
  - [ ] Update API documentation with authentication requirements
  - [ ] Create deployment and configuration guide

## Technical Implementation Details üîß

### JWT Middleware Architecture
```python
# Key components to implement:
# 1. JWTAuthMiddleware class with token validation
# 2. Permission decorators for endpoint protection  
# 3. Workspace context extraction and validation
# 4. Integration with existing FastAPI patterns
```

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
JWT_SECRET_KEY=<secret_key>
JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256
REDIS_URL=<redis_connection> # Optional for blacklisting
SUPABASE_URL=<supabase_url>
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<anon_key>
```

### Security Considerations
- Token validation must check all required claims (sub, workspace_id, permissions, exp, iat)
- Workspace isolation must be enforced at every API endpoint
- Error messages should not leak sensitive information
- Rate limiting should be considered for authentication endpoints
- Audit logging for authentication events

## Dependencies & Blockers üöß

### Dependencies
- Existing Mivaa PDF extractor service (‚úÖ Available)
- JWT integration architecture document (‚úÖ Available)
- Supabase Auth integration patterns (‚úÖ Available)
- Redis instance for blacklisting (‚ö†Ô∏è Optional but recommended)

### Potential Blockers
- Redis configuration for token blacklisting
- Environment variable configuration in deployment
- Database migration coordination with schema alignment task
- Integration testing with frontend authentication flow

## Success Metrics üìä

### Security Metrics
- 100% of Mivaa endpoints protected with authentication
- Zero authentication bypass vulnerabilities in security testing
- Workspace isolation verified through penetration testing
- Performance overhead < 50ms per authenticated request

### Functional Metrics  
- All existing Mivaa functionality preserved with authentication
- Workspace-aware processing working correctly
- Integration with existing Supabase Auth patterns
- Comprehensive test coverage > 90%

## Notes üìù

This is the **highest priority** task as it addresses a critical security vulnerability. The implementation should follow the detailed patterns provided in the JWT integration architecture document. Success of this task unblocks the remaining integration work and enables secure multi-tenant operation of the Mivaa service.
