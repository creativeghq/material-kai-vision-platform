# JWT Security Coordination & Threat Modeling

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

**What is this feature?**
Lead security coordination for the JWT authentication system implementation, focusing on threat modeling, security requirements definition, and coordination with architecture and implementation specialists.

**Why is it needed?**
The current system has critical security gaps including missing JWT token validation, no authentication middleware, and inadequate multi-tenant isolation. A comprehensive security approach is essential to protect the Material Kai Vision Platform from authentication bypass, privilege escalation, and data leakage vulnerabilities.

**Scope:**
- Conduct comprehensive threat modeling for JWT authentication system
- Define security requirements and acceptance criteria for implementation phases
- Coordinate security reviews with architecture and implementation teams
- Establish security testing and validation protocols
- Define incident response procedures for authentication failures

**Links:**
- Current vulnerable implementation: `mivaa-pdf-extractor/app/services/material_kai_service.py`
- Architecture task dependency: `TASK-ARCH-20250725-160726`

## Log Entries ü™µ

**2025-07-26 23:25 - Security Lead Assessment Started**
- Initiated JWT Security Coordination & Threat Modeling task
- Completed vulnerability assessment of material_kai_service.py
- **CRITICAL FINDINGS IDENTIFIED:**

**üö® CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES IN material_kai_service.py:**

1. **NO JWT TOKEN VALIDATION** (Lines 138-142)
   - Service accepts any Bearer token without validation
   - No signature verification, expiration checks, or claims validation
   - **Attack Vector**: Token manipulation, replay attacks, privilege escalation

2. **MISSING AUTHENTICATION MIDDLEWARE**
   - No centralized authentication layer
   - Each service method trusts provided credentials blindly
   - **Attack Vector**: Authentication bypass, unauthorized API access

3. **INADEQUATE WORKSPACE ISOLATION** (Lines 141, 283, 324, 373, 411, 451)
   - Workspace ID passed as header without verification
   - No validation that user has access to specified workspace
   - **Attack Vector**: Cross-tenant data access, privilege escalation

4. **INSECURE API KEY HANDLING** (Lines 76, 99, 138)
   - API keys stored in plain configuration
   - No rotation mechanism or secure storage
   - **Attack Vector**: Credential theft, long-term compromise

5. **NO RATE LIMITING OR THROTTLING**
   - Service lacks protection against abuse
   - **Attack Vector**: DoS attacks, resource exhaustion

6. **INSUFFICIENT INPUT VALIDATION**
   - Document and workflow data not properly sanitized
   - **Attack Vector**: Injection attacks, data corruption

7. **MISSING AUDIT LOGGING**
   - No security event logging for authentication failures
   - **Attack Vector**: Undetected breaches, compliance violations

**RISK ASSESSMENT**: These vulnerabilities create a **CRITICAL** security exposure allowing:
- Complete authentication bypass
- Cross-tenant data access
- Privilege escalation to any workspace
- Undetected malicious activity

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**: JWT authentication system implementation is essential before production deployment.

- **Attack Vectors**: 
  - Token manipulation and forgery (no JWT validation)
  - API endpoint enumeration and abuse
  - Credential stuffing and brute force attacks
  - Man-in-the-middle attacks on unencrypted tokens

**üó∫Ô∏è ATTACK SURFACE MAPPING:**

**Primary Attack Surfaces:**

   - Authorization: Bearer [token] - NO VALIDATION
   - X-Workspace-ID - NO VERIFICATION
   - X-Service-Name - TRUSTED WITHOUT VALIDATION

2. **API Endpoints** (All service methods)
   - /health - Unauthenticated exposure
   - /services/register - Service registration bypass
   - /documents/* - Document access without proper authz
   - /workflows/* - Workflow manipulation
   - WebSocket connections - Real-time attack vector

3. **Configuration Files** (Lines 76, 99)
   - API keys in plain text
   - Workspace IDs in configuration
   - Service credentials exposed

4. **Network Communications**
   - HTTP/HTTPS endpoints without proper validation
   - WebSocket connections without authentication
   - Inter-service communication channels

**Secondary Attack Surfaces:**

2. **Logging Systems** - Credential exposure in logs
3. **Development/Debug Endpoints** - Potential backdoors
4. **Third-party Dependencies** - Supply chain attacks

**ATTACK SCENARIOS IDENTIFIED:**
- **Scenario 1**: Attacker intercepts Bearer token, replays with different Workspace-ID
- **Scenario 2**: Malicious user enumerates workspace IDs for cross-tenant access
- **Scenario 3**: Insider extracts API keys from config, establishes persistent access
- **Scenario 4**: External attacker bypasses authentication entirely via missing validation
