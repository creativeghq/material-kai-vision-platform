# Multi-tenant Isolation: Implement Workspace-aware Security Policies

## Description üéØ

**Critical Security Gap**: The platform lacks comprehensive multi-tenant isolation mechanisms, creating potential for cross-workspace data leakage and unauthorized access. This task implements robust workspace-aware security policies, including Row Level Security (RLS), API-level authorization, and comprehensive isolation validation to ensure complete tenant separation.

**Current State**: 
- ‚úÖ Basic workspace concept exists in the platform
- ‚úÖ JWT authentication architecture designed
- ‚úÖ Database schema supports workspace_id fields
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL**: Missing comprehensive workspace isolation enforcement
- ‚ùå No Row Level Security (RLS) policies implemented
- ‚ùå API endpoints lack workspace-aware authorization
- ‚ùå Cross-workspace data leakage vulnerabilities exist

**Impact**: Without proper multi-tenant isolation, the platform is vulnerable to data breaches, unauthorized access between workspaces, and compliance violations in enterprise environments.

## Technical Implementation Details üîß

### Row Level Security (RLS) Implementation
```sql
-- Example RLS policy for workspace isolation
CREATE POLICY "workspace_isolation_policy" ON documents
    FOR ALL USING (
        workspace_id IN (
            SELECT workspace_id 
            FROM user_workspaces 
            WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
            AND status = 'active'
        )
    );

-- Workspace context setting function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION set_workspace_context(workspace_uuid UUID)
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Validate user has access to workspace
    IF NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM user_workspaces 
        WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
        AND workspace_id = workspace_uuid 
        AND status = 'active'
    ) THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Access denied to workspace';
    END IF;
    
    -- Set workspace context for session
    PERFORM set_config('app.current_workspace_id', workspace_uuid::text, true);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

### Workspace Security Middleware
```typescript
interface WorkspaceSecurityMiddleware {
  extractWorkspaceContext(request: Request): Promise<WorkspaceContext>
  validateWorkspaceAccess(userId: string, workspaceId: string): Promise<boolean>
  enforceWorkspaceIsolation(request: Request, response: Response, next: NextFunction): Promise<void>
  auditWorkspaceAccess(userId: string, workspaceId: string, action: string): Promise<void>
}

interface WorkspaceContext {
  workspaceId: string
  userId: string
  permissions: string[]
  role: WorkspaceRole
}
```

### Authorization Decorators
```typescript
// Workspace access decorator
@RequireWorkspaceAccess(['read', 'write'])
async processDocument(
  @WorkspaceParam() workspaceId: string,
  @Body() documentData: DocumentData
): Promise<ProcessingResult> {
  // Implementation automatically has workspace context
}

// Permission-based authorization
@RequirePermissions(['document:process', 'workspace:write'])
async uploadDocument(
  @WorkspaceParam() workspaceId: string,
  @UploadedFile() file: Express.Multer.File
): Promise<UploadResult> {
  // Implementation with permission validation
}
```

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Workspace security configuration
WORKSPACE_ISOLATION_ENABLED=true
RLS_ENFORCEMENT_STRICT=true
WORKSPACE_AUDIT_LOGGING=true
CROSS_WORKSPACE_ACCESS_DENIED=true
WORKSPACE_CONTEXT_VALIDATION=strict

## Notes üìù

This task is **critical** for enterprise deployment and regulatory compliance. The implementation must be thorough and well-tested, as security vulnerabilities in multi-tenant systems can have severe consequences. Pay special attention to edge cases and ensure that the security policies are both comprehensive and performant. The workspace isolation must be bulletproof - any data leakage between workspaces is unacceptable. Consider implementing this in phases with extensive testing at each stage.
