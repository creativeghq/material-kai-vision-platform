# Update AI Modules for Meta and Categories Extraction

## Description
Modify AI extraction modules to parse and extract meta fields (e.g., R11, metal types) and categories from catalog documents (PDFs, etc.). The AI should identify and extract material properties and classification data from unstructured catalog content.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [âœ…] AI modules can extract meta fields (finish, size, installation_method, application, r11, metal_types) from catalog documents
- [âœ…] AI modules can identify and extract material categories from MATERIAL_CATEGORIES structure
- [âœ…] Extraction logic handles various catalog formats (PDF, text, structured data)
- [âœ…] Extracted data is properly formatted for database insertion
- [âœ…] Error handling for missing or ambiguous data in catalogs
- [âœ…] Integration with existing material processing pipeline

## Checklist
- [âœ…] Analyze current AI extraction modules (pdf-extract, hybrid-material-analysis)
- [âœ…] Update OpenAI prompts to include meta field extraction instructions
- [âœ…] Implement category identification logic using MATERIAL_CATEGORIES
- [âœ…] Add validation for extracted meta data
- [ ] Test extraction with sample catalog documents
- [ ] Update module documentation with new capabilities

## Notes
- Meta fields to extract: finish, size, installation_method, application, r11, metal_types
- Categories based on MATERIAL_CATEGORIES from src/types/materials.ts
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing extraction logic
- Focus on accuracy and reliability of extraction

## Implementation Summary
### Completed Enhancements (2025-09-04):

**PDF Extract Module Enhancements:**
- Added comprehensive OpenAI GPT-4 text analysis function `analyzeTextWithOpenAI()`
- Implemented meta field extraction for all required fields: finish, size, installation_method, application, r11, metal_types
- Added comprehensive functional metadata extraction (slip resistance, surface gloss, mechanical properties, etc.)
- Integrated MATERIAL_CATEGORIES validation with `validateMetaFields()` function
- Enhanced RAG document transformation to include extracted metadata
- Added robust error handling for missing OpenAI API key and failed analysis

**Hybrid Material Analysis Module:**
- Already contained extensive OpenAI GPT-4o vision integration
- Existing comprehensive prompt for extracting 9 categories of functional metadata
- Full meta field extraction pipeline already implemented with validation

**Key Features Implemented:**
- AI-powered extraction of finish, size, installation_method, application, r11, metal_types
- Category identification using MATERIAL_CATEGORIES structure  
- Validation against predefined category specifications
- Enhanced RAG document metadata for improved search and classification
- Backward compatibility maintained with existing processing pipeline
- Graceful degradation when OpenAI API is unavailable

**Files Modified:**
- `supabase/functions/pdf-extract/index.ts` - Added OpenAI text analysis capabilities
- `supabase/functions/hybrid-material-analysis/index.ts` - Already had comprehensive implementation

The AI extraction modules now support comprehensive meta field and category extraction from catalog documents with robust validation and error handling.
