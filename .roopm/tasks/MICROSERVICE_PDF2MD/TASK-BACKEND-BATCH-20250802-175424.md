# Phase 2: Batch Processing Capabilities Implementation

## üìã Description

Implement comprehensive batch processing capabilities for the Mivaa PDF to RAG transformation pipeline. This includes queue-based processing for large documents, progress tracking and status updates, retry mechanisms for failed operations, and performance optimization for bulk operations.

The implementation should integrate seamlessly with the existing Phase 1 services (DocumentChunkingService, EmbeddingGenerationService, MivaaToRagTransformer) and the newly implemented data validation layer.

## üéØ Acceptance Criteria

### Core Batch Processing Infrastructure
- [ ] Queue-based processing system that can handle multiple document transformations concurrently

## üîß Technical Requirements

### Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Queue System**: Redis or in-memory queue implementation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for progress persistence
- **Monitoring**: Built-in metrics collection
- **Testing**: Jest for unit and integration tests

### Performance Targets
- **Throughput**: Process at least 100 documents per minute
- **Memory Usage**: Stay under 2GB for batch operations
- **Error Rate**: Less than 1% permanent failures
- **Recovery Time**: Resume processing within 30 seconds after restart

### Integration Points
- **Phase 1 Services**: DocumentChunkingService, EmbeddingGenerationService, MivaaToRagTransformer
- **Validation Layer**: Use validation middleware for input sanitization

- **Monitoring**: Health check endpoints and metrics exposure

## üìä Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics
- Successful processing of large document batches (100+ documents)
- Zero data loss during batch operations
- Accurate progress tracking and status reporting
- Effective retry and error recovery

### Performance Metrics
- Processing throughput meets or exceeds targets
- Memory usage remains within acceptable limits
- Response times for status queries under 100ms
- System recovery time under 30 seconds

### Quality Metrics
- 100% test coverage for critical batch processing paths
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Clear documentation and examples

## üö® Risk Considerations

### Technical Risks
- Memory exhaustion with large document sets
- Queue overflow during high-load scenarios
- Database connection pool exhaustion
- Race conditions in concurrent processing

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement memory monitoring and throttling
- Add queue size limits and backpressure handling
