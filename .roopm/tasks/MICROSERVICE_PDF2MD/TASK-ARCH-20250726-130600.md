# Database Schema Alignment for Enhanced Vector Search

## Description ✍️

*   **What needs to be done?** Align the database schema to support enhanced vector search capabilities with 1536-dimension embeddings and multi-tenant workspace isolation.
*   **Why is it needed?** To enable the Mivaa PDF extraction service to integrate with the existing RAG system using upgraded vector embeddings and ensure proper workspace-scoped data isolation.
*   **Scope:** 
    - Upgrade vector dimensions from 768 to 1536
    - Implement enhanced vector search RPC functions
    - Create optimized indexes for vector operations
    - Ensure multi-tenant workspace isolation with Row Level Security (RLS)
    - Provide migration and validation utilities

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

*   - [✅] Vector embedding dimensions upgraded to 1536 across all relevant tables
*   - [✅] Enhanced vector search RPC function created with optimized performance
*   - [✅] Proper indexing implemented for vector operations
*   - [✅] Multi-tenant workspace isolation enforced through RLS policies
*   - [✅] Migration utilities provided for data validation and cleanup
*   - [✅] Schema changes compatible with existing RAG system architecture
*   - [✅] Performance optimizations implemented for large-scale vector operations

## Implementation Notes / Sub-Tasks 📝

*   **Completed Migration Work:**
    - ✅ Created comprehensive migration file: `supabase/migrations/20250731_create_enhanced_vector_search.sql`
    - ✅ Implemented `enhanced_vector_search_rpc` function with workspace scoping
    - ✅ Added optimized HNSW indexes for vector similarity search
    - ✅ Created migration utilities: `migrate_embeddings_to_1536` and `validate_vector_migration`
    - ✅ Enhanced schema for `enhanced_knowledge_base` and `materials_catalog` tables
    - ✅ Implemented proper workspace isolation with RLS policies

## Key Learnings 💡

*   **Migration Approach:** The schema alignment was successfully completed through a comprehensive SQL migration that handles both structural changes and data migration utilities.
*   **Performance Considerations:** HNSW indexing was implemented to ensure optimal performance for 1536-dimension vector similarity searches.
*   **Multi-tenant Architecture:** Workspace-scoped RLS policies ensure proper data isolation while maintaining performance.
*   **Integration Ready:** The completed schema changes are fully compatible with the existing RAG system and ready for Mivaa service integration.
