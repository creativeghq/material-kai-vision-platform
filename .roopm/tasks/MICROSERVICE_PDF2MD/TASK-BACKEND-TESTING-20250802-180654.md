# Phase 2: Comprehensive Testing Framework Implementation

## Description

Implement a comprehensive testing framework for all Phase 2 transformation services in the Mivaa PDF to RAG transformation pipeline. This includes unit tests, integration tests, performance validation, and RAG system compatibility testing for the data validation layer, batch processing capabilities, and integration layer.

**Context:** Phase 2 services are now complete:
- Data validation layer (âœ… Done) - 15ms average performance
- Batch processing (ðŸ”„ In Progress) - 100+ docs/min capability  
- Integration layer (ðŸŸ¡ To Do) - Service composition and orchestration

This task focuses on ensuring robust testing coverage across all components to guarantee reliability, performance, and compatibility with the RAG system.
