# Phase 2: Integration Layer with Phase 1 Services

## üìã Description

Implement a comprehensive integration layer that seamlessly connects all Phase 1 services (DocumentChunkingService, EmbeddingGenerationService, MivaaToRagTransformer) with the newly implemented Phase 2 components (data validation layer and batch processing capabilities). This includes updating the DocumentIntegrationService to orchestrate the complete transformation pipeline, implementing proper service composition with dependency injection, adding robust configuration management, and ensuring comprehensive error propagation and handling throughout the system.

The integration layer should provide a unified interface for the entire Mivaa PDF to RAG transformation pipeline while maintaining modularity, testability, and performance.
