# Step 3: DocumentIntegrationService Refactor - DI Container Integration

## üìã Description

Refactor the DocumentIntegrationService to leverage the newly implemented dependency injection container system. This refactor will transform the service from manual dependency management to a clean, container-managed orchestration service that uses constructor injection and interface-based dependencies.

The DocumentIntegrationService currently serves as the main orchestration layer for the PDF2MD microservice system. By integrating it with the DI container, we will achieve better separation of concerns, improved testability, and a more maintainable architecture that follows modern dependency injection patterns.

This refactor builds upon the completed centralized configuration management (Step 1) and dependency injection container (Step 2) implementations, creating a cohesive service architecture.
