# Description
Perform a comprehensive code review of the Mivaa PDF Extractor codebase, paying close attention to common AI code generation issues and subtleties.

# Acceptance Criteria
- Identify any method calls, functions, or libraries that don't actually exist (Hallucinated APIs and Libraries).
- Identify objects with missing properties in TypeScript interfaces (Incomplete Type Definitions).
- Verify handling of empty arrays, null inputs, and undefined values (Edge Case Handling).
- Identify race conditions in concurrent operations (Asynchronous Execution Bugs).
- Check for incorrect usage of web frameworks (Express, NestJS, etc.) (Framework-Specific Misunderstandings).
- Look for inefficient query patterns or N+1 problems (Database and ORM Issues).
- Check for mismatches between API contracts and implementations (Frontend/Backend Integration Problems).
- Identify improper input sanitization (Security Vulnerabilities).
- Verify that error handling follows a consistent pattern (Error Handling Consistency).
- Identify business logic that doesn't match requirements (Context-Specific Logic).
- Identify critical paths lacking test coverage (Testing Blind Spots).
- Check for hardcoded values that should be configurable (Environment and Configuration).
