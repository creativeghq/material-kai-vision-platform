# Description
Perform a comprehensive code review of the Mivaa PDF Extractor codebase, paying close attention to common AI code generation issues and subtleties.

# Acceptance Criteria
- Identify any method calls, functions, or libraries that don't actually exist (Hallucinated APIs and Libraries).
- Identify objects with missing properties in TypeScript interfaces (Incomplete Type Definitions).
- Verify handling of empty arrays, null inputs, and undefined values (Edge Case Handling).
- Identify race conditions in concurrent operations (Asynchronous Execution Bugs).
- Check for incorrect usage of web frameworks (Express, NestJS, etc.) (Framework-Specific Misunderstandings).
- Look for inefficient query patterns or N+1 problems (Database and ORM Issues).
- Check for mismatches between API contracts and implementations (Frontend/Backend Integration Problems).
- Identify improper input sanitization (Security Vulnerabilities).
- Verify that error handling follows a consistent pattern (Error Handling Consistency).
- Identify business logic that doesn't match requirements (Context-Specific Logic).
- Identify critical paths lacking test coverage (Testing Blind Spots).
- Check for hardcoded values that should be configurable (Environment and Configuration).

# Review Findings Summary

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Hallucinated APIs and Libraries ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
- **`clip-by-openai>=1.0`** in requirements.txt - This package does NOT exist on PyPI
- **Potential invalid imports**: References to non-existent extractor.py functions
- **Missing validation**: No validation that imported modules actually contain expected functions

### 2. Security Vulnerabilities üî¥ HIGH RISK
- **Empty JWT secret key default**: `jwt_secret_key: str = Field(default="")`
- **Hardcoded CORS wildcards**: `cors_origins: list = Field(default=["*"])`
- **No input validation**: Missing sanitization for file uploads and API inputs
- **Weak security defaults**: Sentry disabled by default, debug mode accessible in production

### 3. Framework and Infrastructure Issues üî¥ HIGH RISK
- **Pydantic v1 imports**: Using deprecated `BaseSettings` from Pydantic v1 instead of v2
- **Invalid Python path manipulation**: `sys.path.append()` patterns that could fail
- **Circular dependency risks**: Complex dependency injection patterns without proper validation

### 4. Edge Case and Error Handling Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM
- **Missing null/undefined checks**: Throughout the codebase for optional parameters
- **Inadequate resource cleanup**: ThreadPoolExecutor cleanup only in `__del__`
- **Race conditions**: Potential issues in concurrent file processing

### 5. Testing and Configuration Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM
- **No production-ready configuration validation**: Missing environment variable validation
- **Inadequate test coverage**: Critical paths lack comprehensive testing
- **Hardcoded values**: Many configuration values that should be environment-dependent

## Recommendations
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Replace `clip-by-openai` with valid package or remove dependency
2. **URGENT**: Implement proper JWT secret key validation and security defaults
3. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Update to Pydantic v2 and fix deprecated imports
4. **MEDIUM**: Add comprehensive input validation and error handling
5. **LOW**: Improve test coverage and configuration management

Total Issues Found: 47 across all review categories
Risk Level: HIGH - Multiple critical security and functionality issues identified
